# HL7 FHIR Validation Service

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-community/fhir-validator-wrapper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-community/fhir-validator-wrapper)

The `fhir-validator-wrapper` provides a persistent service for executing the 
[FHIRÂ® Validator](https://wiki.hl7.org/Using_the_FHIR_Validator). It is intended to provide validation capabilities
to other applications that integrate it.

## REST API

**[See here](rest-api.md) for the REST API documentation.**

## Installation

**System Requirements:** The Validation Service requires Java 1.8 or above.

## Running Locally with Java

To build and run the test suite:

### *nix
```shell script
./gradlew build check test
```

### Windows
```shell script
gradlew.bat build check test
```

To run the app:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```

The port can also be set through the environment
```shell script
VALIDATOR_PORT=8080 ./gradlew run
```

## Running with Docker

Build
```shell script
./build_docker.sh
```
Run
```shell script
docker run -p 4567:4567 hl7_validator
```

Run with a different terminology server:
```shell script
docker run -p 4567:4567 --env TX_SERVER_URL=http://mytx.org/r4 hl7_validator
```

Run without terminology validation:
```shell script
docker run -p 4567:4567 --env DISABLE_TX=true hl7_validator
```

## Creating an Uber Jar

An uber jar can be created with:

```shell
./gradlew uberJar
```

By default, the uber jar will be located in `build/lib/`.

This uber jar can be executed with `java -jar InfernoValidationService-<version>-uber.jar`
