# Inferno Resource Validation Service

## ⚠️ NOTICE ⚠️ 
The Inferno Framework is transitioning away from this `inferno-framework/fhir-validator-wrapper`
to the [HL7® validator-wrapper](https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.validator-wrapper) 
and this repository will soon be officially retired.

---

The `inferno-framework/fhir-validator-wrapper` provides a persistent service for
executing the [HL7® FHIR®
Validator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator),
which historically only was available as a Java library and a CLI-based tool.
This lightweight wrapper enables applications not implemented in Java, such as
the [Inferno Framework](https://inferno-framework.github.io), to interface with
the HL7 Validator in a service environment.  It is primarily being used within
the Inferno Framework to provide FHIR validation services for tests, as well as
to provide a [simple web-based
UI](https://github.com/inferno-framework/fhir-validator-app) for validating FHIR
resources.

Since this is just a lightweight wrapper around the HL7 FHIR Validator, most of
the functionality provided by this service is [implemented within the HL7 FHIR
Validator](https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core), which is
developed and maintained independently of this project.

The team that maintains the HL7 FHIR Validator has since created [their
own service API](https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.validator-wrapper) for
the HL7 FHIR validator, making this wrapper service redundant.  This GitHub
project may be retired in favor of using that service, but will be maintained as
long as the Inferno set of tools continues to use it.

## REST API

**[See here](rest-api.md) for the REST API documentation.**

## Installation

**System Requirements:** The Validation Service requires Java 11 or above.

## Running Locally with Java

To build and run the test suite:

### *nix

```shell script
./gradlew build check test
```

### Windows

```shell script
gradlew.bat build check test
```

To run the app:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```

The port can also be set through the environment

```shell script
VALIDATOR_PORT=8080 ./gradlew run
```

## Running with Docker

Build


```shell script
./build_docker.sh
```

Run

```shell script
docker run -p 4567:4567 hl7_validator
```

Run with a different terminology server:

```shell script
docker run -p 4567:4567 --env TX_SERVER_URL=http://mytx.org/r4 hl7_validator
```

Run without terminology validation:

```shell script
docker run -p 4567:4567 --env DISABLE_TX=true hl7_validator
```

By default, the validator will return errors when a code display doesn't match the expected value from the terminology server. To return warnings instead:

```shell script
docker run -p 4567:4567 --env DISPLAY_ISSUES_ARE_WARNINGS=true hl7_validator
```

## Creating an Uber Jar

An uber jar can be created with:

```shell
./gradlew uberJar
```

By default, the uber jar will be located in `build/lib/`.

This uber jar can be executed with `java -jar InfernoValidationService-<version>-uber.jar`

channel](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/153-inferno).
